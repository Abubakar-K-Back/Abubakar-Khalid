# Abubakar-Data-Science-Portfolio
My Data science Portfolio which contains some of my projects

# [Anomaly detection in Synthea Dataset Using Luminaire.](https://github.com/abubakar123SVD/anomaly-detection-using-luminaire)
1. In this project i have detected Anomalies in synthea patient dataset
2. Dataset was contained by https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/CSV-File-Data-Dictionary#claims-transactions
3. I proprocessed the data and removed the irrelevent data from the csv
4. Final result is a prediction about the patients spending on health each year
5. Model can be used by health insurance companies and other organizations

# [Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/abubakar123SVD/Honda-Civic-Price-Prediction)
1. In this project scrape cars data from Pakwheels.com using selenium scraping
2. Total rows in dataset were 4600
3. Preprocessed using Pandas and removed the irrelevent data from the csv
4. After preprocessing i have performed EDA to see the correlation e.g CC, Year, Transmission and City etc 
5. Then I have trained 4 models using Random Forest, KNN, Linear Regression and Lasso Regression
6. Model can be used by car rentals, car sellers and buyers
7. User dont have to scroll through all the pages and do the hustle just have to enter the details and model will predict the approximate price in specific city

# [Stock Market Index Prediction Using Auto Arima Models.](https://github.com/abubakar123SVD/Auto-Arima-Stock-Prediction)
1. In this project i have predicted opening prices of Pakistan Stock Exchange
2. Dataset was contained by Kaggle
3. I proprocessed the data and removed the irrelevent data, dates, weekends and anomalies from data from the csv
4. I have used Auto regressive integrated moving average to predict the trend
5. Average accuracy of each company is about 87%
7. project can be seen through a website made up in reactjs deployed through heroku http://autoarima.herokuapp.com/Login
8. Model can be used by financial institutes, banks, investment brokers and bitcoin tradings

# [House Price Prediction Using Google tensorflow](https://github.com/abubakar123SVD/House-Price-prediction-)
1. In this project i have used google tensorflow
2. Dataset was contained by Kaggle
3. first data has been visualised and analysed
4. Used Keras Sequential layers.
5. I have selected right labels to train the price e.g rooms, parking lot, area etc
6. After this i preprocessed the labels and drop the irrelevent labels e.g creation date, phone number etc.
7. Accuracy of each company is about 90%
8. Model can be used by Real Estate companies.

# [Heart Attack Classification using KNN, SVM, RFC, NBC ](https://github.com/abubakar123SVD/Heart-Attack-Prediction-Machine-Learning)
1. In this project i have used classification algorithms
2. Dataset was contained by Kaggle
3. First data has been visualized using seaborn and matplotlib
4. In visualization we can see the relationship of factors with heart attack in patients
5. I have used KNN, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Naive Bayes Classifier
6. then match the accuracy of each model
7. Support vector machine gives the best accuracy
8. Model can be used by Health insurance Companies, Hospitals, and other health organizations.
